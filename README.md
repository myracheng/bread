# BREADME: A Recipe Log

Hi! Here are some of the things I've baked and the narratives surrounding them. Asterisks denote recipes I would make again (and again and again).

My tenets
- slow down and maximize resting (allowing time for flavor development)
- minimize waste (use up random ingredients that have been lying around)
- chuck everything in the bread machine, pizza dough setting.
- minimize bowl-washing and sifting
- value taste over looks
- reduce the sugar
- go nuts, add nuts
- follow intuition over precise measurements
- question, explore, and develop origins and narratives of recipes

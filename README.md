# BREADME: A Recipe Log

Hi! Here are some of the things I've baked and the narratives surrounding them. Asterisks denote recipes I would make again (and again and again).

### Values
- Slow down and maximize resting; allow time for flavor development
- Minimize waste (use up random ingredients that have been lying around), bowl-washing and sifting
- Pizza dough setting in bread machine
- Taste over looks, intuition over precise measurements
- Less sugar, more nuts
- Question, explore, and develop origins and narratives

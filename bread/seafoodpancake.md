Time: 30 min

Notes: I mixed some of the seafood into the batter, which made it kind of uneven. I also kinda skimped on the scallions.

Story:

## Ingredients

|Ingredient|Amount|
|---|---:|
|scallions|many bunches|
|chopped seafood|2 cups|
|all-purpose flour|3/4 cup|
|tapioca flour|1/4 cup|
|sugar|pinch|
|salt|pinch|
|ice-cold water|1 cup + 2 tbsp|
|eggs|1|
|oil|2 tbsp|


## Instructions
1. Combine the dry ingredients of the batter in a medium-sized bowl. Slowly stir in the water and mix with a spatula until it forms a smooth, runny batter that can just coat the back of a spoon (thinner than pancake, thicker than crepe). Add a bit more water if the batter is still a bit thick and mix again.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet until hot.
3. Add half the green onions to the pan in a single even layer, forming a rectangle about 7” by 9” (18 cm by 23 cm).
4. Drizzle about 1/4 cup of batter evenly over the green onions.
5. Spread 1/3 cup of seafood mix evenly across the pancake and drizzle another 1/4 cup of batter evenly over the seafood.
6. Turn the heat to medium and allow the pancake to cook for 1 minute.
7. Add half of the beaten egg over the pancake and spread it with a brush or a spoon to form an even layer.
8. Cook the pancake for another 1 to 2 minutes, occasionally checking underneath, until it is browned and crisp.
9. In one fluid motion, flip the pancake using a spatula (or two spatulas). It may be necessary to add another tablespoon of oil to the pan.
10. Cook the pancake until the seafood side is browned and cooked through, another 2 to 4 minutes.

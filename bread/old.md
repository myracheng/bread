Time: 2 days

Notes: The normal ones turned out great (a bit small because I made 8) but the raisin ones just looked totally wonky - possibly because of the sugar/water/yeast that the broken raisins released, or the over-kneading to incorporate raisins into the dough? I would also put less molasses next time. But my stomach kinda hurt and the only thing that I wanted to eat is bagels, so I ate like 1.5 demented cinnamon raisin bagels. There are so many variations I want to try: whole-wheat, rye, cinnamon-raisin properly, matcha/turmeric/cocoa/rainbow, chili flakes.... maybe a steam bath?

Story: idk man i just wanted to make bagels.

## Instructions
1. Combine dough ingredients for 3 minutes until well blended. The dough should form a stiff, coarse ball, and the flour should be fully hydrated; if it isn’t, stir in a little more water. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
2. Resume mixing with the dough hook on the lowest speed for another 3 minutes. The dough should be stiff yet supple, with a satiny, barely tacky feel. If the dough seems too soft or overly tacky, mix or knead in a little more flour.
Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and stick in fridge overnight or up to 2 days.
3. When you’re ready to shape the bagels, prepare a sheet pan by lining it with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 6 to *8* equal pieces. Form each piece into a loose ball by rolling it on a clean, dry work surface with a cupped hand. (Don’t use any flour on the work surface. If the dough slides around and won’t ball up, wipe the surface with a damp paper towel and try again; the slight bit of moisture will provide enough traction for the dough to form into a ball.)
4. Two methods to shape: The first method is to poke a hole through the center of the ball to create a donut shape. Holding the dough with both thumbs in the hole, rotate the dough with your hands, gradually stretching it to create a hole about 2 inches in diameter. The second method, preferred by professional bagel makers, didnt work for me...maybe makign the ropes more even would have been [good](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2020/01/15/how-to-shape-bagels).
5. Proof 60 to 90 minutes, and check whether the bagels are ready for baking using the “float test”: Place one of the bagels in a small bowl of cold water. If it sinks and doesn’t float back to the surface, shake it off, return it to the pan, and wait for another 15 to 20 minutes, then test it again. If they pass the float test before you are ready to boil and bake them, return them to the refrigerator so they don’t overproof. 
6. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) and gather and prepare your garnishes (seeds, onions, garlic, and so on).
7. To make the poaching liquid, fill a pot with 2 to 3 quarts (64 to 96 oz / 181 to 272 g) of water, making sure the water is at least 4 inches deep. Cover, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain at a simmer. Stir in the GOODS.
8. Gently lower each bagel into the simmering poaching liquid, adding as many as will comfortably fit in the pot. They should all float to the surface within 15 seconds. After 1 minute, use a slotted spoon to turn each bagel over. Poach for another 30 to 60 seconds, then use the slotted spoon to transfer it back to the pan, domed side up. 
9. Sprinkle on a generous amount of whatever toppings you like as soon as the bagels come out of the water.
10. Transfer the pan of bagels to the oven, then lower the oven heat to 450°F (232°C). Bake for 15 minutes.

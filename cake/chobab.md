Time: 2 days

Notes: The filling was too crumbly since I didn't want to make it too sweet with the molasses. BUt this is sooo delicious. It would be good to roll it out thinner and make sure the filling is spread all the way to the edge for the most elaborate spiral, and I'd probably add half the amount of cracker crumbs so that the filling is more spreadable and less crumbly. Or maybe add some heavy cream? But it's already so rich...

Story: I've long been hesitant about babka - I already feel satisfied by the red bean swirl/milk bread combination, and have a hard time imagining a sweet bread better than that. But I love finding recipes that allow me to use up random almost-empty boxes of cheerios and graham crackers, and the swirls in the Food and Wine magazine looked really beautiful and clean. In retrospect, I would decidedly classify this as a (yeasted) cake, but it's so yummy! I totally get why this would be appropriate as a birthday cake. My sister says "it looks like red bean paste from afar, but then you realize it's chocolate and get excited" - the opposite of the raisins-masquerading-as-chocolate phenomenon. So I guess here's yet another Jewish recipe...

## Instructions
1. Make the dough: Activate the yeast with a bit of warm water. Combine the flour, sugar, yeast and zest. Add eggs and 1/2 cup water, mixing with the dough hook until it comes together; this may take a couple minutes. It’s okay if it’s on the dry side, but if it doesn’t come together at all, add extra water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms a mass. 

2. Add the salt, then the butter, a spoonful at a time, mixing until it’s incorporated into the dough. Then, mix on medium speed for 10 minutes until dough is completely smooth; you’ll need to scrape the bowl down a few times. I usually found that after 10 minutes, the dough began to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If it doesn’t, you can add 1 tablespoon extra flour to help this along.

3. Put dough in airtight container and refrigerate for half a day, preferably overnight. (Dough will not fully double)

4. Make filling: Melt chocolate and butter. Stir in cookie crumbs and molasses. Let cool until spreadable consistency (this got way too dense and crumbly :( ))

5. Line 8x4 pan with parchment paper. Roll out on a well-floured counter to about a 10-inch width (the side closest to you) and as long in length (away from you) as you can when rolling it thin, likely 10 to 12 inches.

6. Use an offset spatula (or hands lol) to spread two-thirds of one portion of the filling evenly over the surface of the dough, *taking care to spread the filling to the edges*. Gently roll the dough away from you to form a fat roll. Pick the babka roll up with two hands and give it a gentle pull on both ends to elongate it slightly. Set the roll down and cut it in half through the middle so you have 2 rolls, each approximately 10 inches long.

7. Spread the remaining portion of filling across the top of one of the 2 halves and place the second half on top of the filling to form an X with the 2 rolls of dough. Twist the ends of the bottom roll up and over the top roll to cover the filling. (basically just twist the two strands around each other)

8. Cover and leave to rise another 3 hours (?) at room temperature. (The dough will not double, but it will look lighter)

9. Heat oven to 350°F. Bake for 40 minutes, but there’s no harm in checking for doneness at 25 minutes. A skewer inserted into an underbaked babka will feel stretchy/rubbery inside and may come back with dough on it. When fully baked, you’ll feel almost no resistance. 

10. While babkas are baking, make syrup: Bring sugar and water to a simmer until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and set aside to cool somewhat. As soon as the babkas leave the oven, brush the syrup all over each. It will seem like too much, but will taste just right — glossy and moist. Let cool about halfway in pan, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way before eating.

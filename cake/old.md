## Ingredients
 
|Ingredient|Amount|
|---|---:|
|all-purpose flour |69 g|
|tapioca starch |6g|
|sugar|85 g|
|baking powder|1 tsp|
|eggs|3|
|oil|40 g|
|navel orange|1 large|
|ground cardamom|1 tsp|

## Instructions
1. Gather all the ingredients and a deep 6-inch cake pan. Grease the bottom of the cake pan only.
2. Preheat the oven to 325ºF. Separate 3 eggs to yolks and whites. 
3. Add 1/3 of the sugar to the egg yolks. Add oil, cardamom,, and orange zest.
4. Juice the orange to obtain 60 g of juice, and add it to the egg mixture. Also add the flour, tapioca starch, and baking powder. Whisk until totally incorporated and make sure there are no lumps.
5. Whip the egg whites till opaque and fomay, Then add the rest of the sugar, and whisk until stiff peaks. (until the tip is soft enough that it folds over, like taking a bow.)
6. Using a whisk, fold in ⅓ of the egg whites in the batter until the mixture is homogeneous.
7. Fold in the rest of egg whites in 2-3 increments and mix gently until the mixture is homogeneous.
8. Pour into pan, and drop the pan gently to reduce uneven air pockets. Do not scrape the bowl! (Pour the extras into a separate vessel)
9. Bake for 30 minutes.
10. Drop it gently on the kitchen counter to stop shrinking. The cake must be cooled upside down in its pan so that it stretches downward instead of collapsing. Let it cool completely.
11. To extract the cake, run a thin sharp knife or thin offset spatula around both the outer and inner edge of the cake.
12. Remove the cake from the pan and run the knife on the bottom. Move onto a serving plate.
